            <h3>What is Dungons and Dragons</h3>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Dungeons and Dragons is a classic TTRPG (Tabletop Role Playing Game) to bring friends together and adventure through mystical fantasy worlds.
                    There are 2 roles in the game, the Dungeon Master or Game Master and the Player characters. Normally 1 person will take on the role of DM or Dungeon Master
                    and any amount of player characters. The game is noramlly played within groups of 3-6 player characters to 1 DM. Players will adventure through planned adventures made
                    by the DM or using "modules" that are published. You can find official modules through the Dungeons and Dragons website or fan made modules on sites such as Patreon. Players will
                    create character sheets where you select a class, backstory, race, and their starting equipment. This can be easily created through the Dungeons and Dragons website with their character
                    creators and create your character sheet that will outline what your character can do and what scores the character has. The DM will control everything happening around the characters, the 
                    monsters they fight, what the players can see around them and what is happening in the world around them.

            <h3>How do we play?</h3>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Dungeons and Dragons is a dice game, in order for your character to take actions in the fantasy world around you they will need to roll a specified dice to determine how things will pan out.
                    Everyone who plays will need to have a set of specific dice with them. Having multiple of each dice makes rolling spells and abilities more efficient and who doesn't like having pretty dice
                    to show off to everyone else! The dice we use are, D100, D20, D12, D10, D8, D6, D4, and sometimes a D2. When taking certain actions your DM may ask, please roll 3d6. What this means is that we take
                    3 dice that have 6 sides and roll them all to determine what happens. In our example most spells will use the lower numbered dice, D10, D8, D6, D4 to determine damage and attacks. All actions
                    that your character makes will be determined through the D20 dice. When you want to look around or go for that attack you will roll the D20 to determine how successful your action is. Depending on
                    the difficulty of the action that is determined by the DM, The DM will tell you what happens in the next few moments. Originally the game is played through imagination also known as "Theatre of Mind"
                    where the players will need to visualize in their head what is happening around them through descriptions and story telling from the DM. As technology has advanced resources like battlemaps and VTT programs
                    have made it easier for new players to visualize what is happening around them. Any mix of both playstyles will suit whatever game you are trying to play, it's up to the DM's discretion on how these things
                    are implemented.
